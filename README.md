### If the user has already registered for the given month, then we see a pop up message, which restricts the user from registering again for the same month (Even for different batch time)

## Additional notes

### The project uses React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.
### MongoDB is used as the database to store user information.
### The admission form enforces age limits, batch selection rules, and prevents duplicate registrations within the same month.
